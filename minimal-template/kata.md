# Roman numerals
Write a function to convert Arabic numbers to Roman numerals as best as you can, following the TDD practices we have been using.

Given a positive integer number (for example, 42), determine its Roman numeral representation as a string (for example, XLII). You cannot write numerals like IM for 999.
